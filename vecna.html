    <h1>Vecna</h1>
    <p>A fearsome sentient creature aligned with the Upside Down, Vecna had humble origins as the human Henry Creel. After moving to a new home in Hawkins in March 1959, the young Henry discovered he had remarkable psychokinetic abilities and could alter the perception of others. Motivated by a misanthropic and nihilistic philosophy, Henry used his powers to psychologically torture his family, eventually killing his mother and sister, and then framing his fatherfor these crimes, which drove him to madness.</p>
